      <h2>What is St.Pockets Day?</h2>
      <p>St.Pockets Day (November 15th) is an orignal holiday invented by Edward F. Hartman in the 1600s. It was made in honor of Sullivan James Pockets, who, because he only had one hand, sewed his purse to his trousers, essentially inventing the pocket. The pocket quickly spread throughout Europe, along with the story of the man who invented it. Pockets was thought to be a genuis, and was invited to balls and galas by many different distinguished people. The Queen of Transylvania knighted him, making him Sir Pockets. Cambridge University gave him a degree, making him Dr.Pockets. Sadly, he died shortly before the pope officially declared him a saint, but we still choose to remember him as St.Pockets.</p>

      <h2>The St.Patrick Conspiracy</h2>
      <p>Sadly, not every one is a fan of St.Pockets day, and many justify this by saying that St.Pockets day is a twist on the lesser known holiday <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick's_Day" target = "_blank">St.Patrick's day</a>. Needless to say, this theory is ridiculous, St.Patrick's day was invented by the Irish to substitute for St.pockets day, because of rumors that Pockets was Scottish. There is little to no evidence suggesting Pockets was Scottish, but the Irish hated him anyway, even after he drove all the snakes from there country as a peace offering.</p>
